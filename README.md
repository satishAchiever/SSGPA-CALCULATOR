# SGPA Calculator

This is a simple Python program that calculates the SGPA (Semester Grade Point Average) based on the number of subjects and lab externals entered by the user.

## About the Project
I wrote this small project to make it easier to calculate SGPA manually.  
Instead of doing all the credit and grade calculations by hand, this program takes the number of subjects and labs, their credits, and grades, and then gives the SGPA directly.

It uses standard grade points:
- A+ = 10  
- A = 9  
- B = 8  
- C = 7  
- D = 6  
- E = 5  
- F = 0

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have **Python 3** installed on your computer.
2. Download or clone this repository.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt in the same folder.
4. Run the script using:

   ```bash
   python sgpa_calculator.py
Enter the Number of subjects 3
Enter the Number of lab Externals 2
1.subject Credits = 3
2.subject Credits = 4
3.subject Credits = 3
1.lab Credits = 1.5
2.lab Credits = 1.5
Total Credits = 13.0
subject grades A+
subject grades B
subject grades C
lab grades A
lab grades B
Subject point * subject credits =  77
lab point * lab credits =  25.5
your sgpa =  7.9
